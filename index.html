					First things first</strong>, sign up for Bluemix! <font class = coralbold><u><a href="https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#" target = "_blank">What is Bluemix</a></u></font>, you ask? It's IBM's simple and flexible <font class = coralbold>cloud development platform</font>. Whether you're looking to build a <font class = coralbold>web app or a mobile backend in the cloud</font>, Bluemix has you covered with a variety of <font class = coralbold>runtimes </font><strong>(like Node.js, Python, Ruby on Rails, Java, etc...)</strong> and <font class = coralbold>services</font> <strong>(like Mobile Push, Cloudant, Twilio, MongoLab, etc...)</strong> that we're sure will fit your app's use case.
				</p>
				<p class="white">
					Since this is a relatively short event, a <font class = coralbold>Bluemix 30-day free trial</font> is well suited to anything you're looking to build for now - <font class = coralbold>no up front credit card required either</font>! Once everything is said and done (and you've won, right), you'll have an awesome app running on Bluemix and all the enterprise-grade tools at your disposal to take it to the next level.

				<p class="white">Log in and start playing! Head over to the catalog and <span class = "tealbold">spin up a boilerplate or a standalone runtime</span> that works for you. Node.js, Ruby, and Java come standard, but you can bring your own (i.e. Python, PHP, etc...) from the Cloud Foundry community. Be sure to check out all of the different <span class = "tealbold">IBM, third party, and community services</span> available in the catalog as well.</p>

				<p class="white">Once your boilerplate/runtime is up and running, follow its "<span class = "tealbold">getting started</span>" guide to download:
					<ul>
						<li>the starter code that sits behind it</li>
						<li>the Cloud Foundry command line installer so that you can push your work back up to Bluemix</li>

					Once you've installed the Cloud Foundry command line tool, <span class = "tealbold">open that starter code</span> in the editor of your choice and <span class = "tealbold">make a change, any change</span>. Let us guess, you added the text "Hello Hackathon" somewhere in the UI, didn't you?
				</p>
				<p class="white">
					Once your code is saved (and compiled if you're using Java), <span class = "tealbold">cf push</span> back to Bluemix using the command line and realize the fruits of your labor, live in the cloud! For more info on pushing your code up to Bluemix, see the link below.
				</p>
				<p class="white"><span class = "tealbold">
					P.S.</span> You don't always have to use the command line to push your code into Bluemix, this is just a good place to start. For more options, search the docs for our <span class = "tealbold">online editor</span>, <span class = "tealbold">Bluemix Eclipse Plugin</span>, or just Google <span class = "tealbold">any other Cloud Foundry compatible IDE plugins</span>.

				<h2 class="teal">IDEATE</h2>
				<p class="white">
					Now that you understand the basics, start thinking (if you haven't already) about <span class = "tealbold">what you actually want to build at this hackathon</span>!
				</p>
				<h3 class="white">Ideation Activity</h3>
				<p class="white">
					First ask yourself, <span class = "tealbold">who is the end user of my app</span> and <span class = "tealbold">what problem(s) am I trying to solve for this persona</span>? Really put yourself in your user's shoes and then write down <span class = "tealbold">as many ideas</span> (even crazy ones) as you can that might solve one or more of their problems.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Grid-cell pad-right pad-left contentblock">
				<p class="white">
					We typically recommend <span class = "tealbold">sticky notes</span> for this ideation exercise - especially if you're working with a team.
				</p>
				<p class="white">
					Silently throw <span class = "tealbold">one idea per sticky</span> note up on a wall (time box this to only a few minutes), <span class = "tealbold">group them together</span> based on commonalities, notice any <span class = "tealbold">trends</span>, and then <span class = "tealbold">vote on what makes the most sense</span>. You'll be amazed at how much focus this will bring to you and your team (if you're working on one - alone is cool too)!

					As you further define what you're actually going to build, <span class = "tealbold">look through the Bluemix catalog again</span>.

					Go to the overview pane for any Bluemix app you've created and click <span class = "tealbold">Add GIT</span> up at the top by the app's url. This will place that initial starter code you edited a few steps back into an <span class = "tealbold">IBM GIT repo</span>. It links directly to your app in Bluemix (and can auto-deploy to it when the origin is updated). Your source code is kept private by default.
